✅ Replit Prompt: Dice Counting & Subtraction Funland — Preschool Counting & Subtraction App

Title: Dice Counting & Subtraction Funland
Target age: 4–6 years (preschool → Grade 1 readiness)
Goal: Build a joyful, tactile app that teaches counting to 12, subitizing, number sequencing, and visual subtraction (take-away) using dice, movement, animated characters, and simple drag/drop interactions. No reading required.

🌟 High-level Requirements

Browser app built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (no heavy frameworks required).

Responsive for tablet/phone and Chromebook; touch-first interactions.

Clean, modular code (ES6 modules).

Smooth animations and child-friendly audio cues.

Lightweight assets for low-end devices.

All assets local (no external CDNs) so it runs offline after load.

🎲 Core Gameplay Modules (each a separate JS module)

Home / Hub

Big Start button, avatar select (choose Dino / Mimi / Hugo / Pip), settings (audio on/off), Parent/Teacher mode.

Progress panel showing badges/stickers.

Module A — Dice Roll & Count

Single or double dice mode (configurable).

Roll animation + spoken audio (e.g., “You rolled six!”).

Visual: large dice, counters appear; child taps to count or drags counters to a target.

Learning: subitizing with single die patterns (1–6) and combined totals (7–12).

Module B — Dice Jump Path (Number Line)

Floor number line 0–12; physical/haptic jump visuals.

Child rolls a die and the avatar hops forward; optional “start at 10 and go backwards” variant.

Mini challenges: land exactly on target, reach a checkpoint.

Module C — Dice Feeding / Take Away (Subtraction Stories)

Short, narrated story scenes (e.g., “Hugo has 7 apples. 2 fly away!”).

Use counters/animal food; animate items leaving the scene; child counts remaining.

Supports dice-driven events (roll → how many are taken away).

Module D — Tiny Subtraction Puzzles (Multiple Choice Visuals)

Show an initial quantity (icons), animate X items removed, show 3 answer bubbles (tap).

Friendly feedback for correct/incorrect answers; gentle nudge for wrong answers (e.g., hint animation).

Module E — Match & Race (Timed Playful Rounds)

Match dice pattern to numeral quickly (timed friendly rounds).

Race element with on-screen friends to add fun and build speed.

🧩 UX / Design Guidelines

Big, rounded buttons (>48px target) and large touch targets.

High contrast, saturated preschool palette, but avoid neon.

Minimal text — use voice prompts and icons.

Simple consistent navigation: Back, Replay, Home.

Soft background music with mute toggle.

Accessibility: audio descriptions of actions, large fonts for parents.

🔊 Audio & Feedback

Spoken prompts for instructions (female/male friendly neutral voice).

Sounds: dice roll, hop, cheer, gentle buzzer for wrong answer.

Visual celebration: confetti, stickers, stars.

Sticker collection (gallery) and badges (e.g., Counting Champ, Subtraction Star).

🧾 Teacher / Parent Mode (optional but recommended)

Toggle difficulty: Dice range (1–6 vs 1–12), enable 2-dice combos.

Set lesson length (5/10/15 rounds).

View simple session log: rounds played, percent correct, badges earned. (Local only; no cloud unless specified.)

🛠 Technical Implementation Notes

Use requestAnimationFrame for animations.

Implement drag & drop with pointer events (pointerdown/pointermove/pointerup) for cross-device compatibility.

Simple virtual dice: render as animated sprites or CSS transforms. Optionally use <canvas> for dice visuals.

Use Web Audio API for sound playback (preload and handle user gesture requirement).

Store progress in localStorage (use storage.js wrapper).

Keep asset sizes small (spritesheets, compressed audio ~64–128 kbps).

🎨 Assets Required (minimal starter list)

Avatar sprites: Dino, Mimi, Hugo, Pip (idle + celebrate + jump).

Dice faces 1–6 (and combined imagery for 7–12 if desired).

Counter icons: apples, tokens, animals.

Backgrounds: Dice Town main, number line scene, feeding scene, puzzle backdrop.

UI icons: play, replay, home, back, badge, backpack.

Sounds: roll.mp3, cheer.mp3, correct.wav, wrong.wav, click.wav, ambient_loop.mp3.

Spoken audio lines for all prompts (or implement TTS fallback).

✅ Deliverables (for sprint)

Fully playable MVP with Modules A–C (Dice Roll & Count, Dice Jump Path, Feeding/Subtraction).

Polish: celebration effects, stickers, at least 8 story puzzles.

Responsive layout + tested on phone/tablet/browser.

README describing how to run, build steps, and where to add new puzzles.

Optional: simple Teacher Mode panel and local session log.

🧪 Testing Checklist

Touch interactions: drag/drop, tap accuracy.

Dice randomness and animation feel.

Audio plays only after first user gesture (mobile browsers).

No negative subtraction allowed — ensure removing count never goes below zero; if dice would cause negative, re-roll or clamp and explain.

Accessibility check: audio cues for every screen change.

🔀 Bonus Features (future sprints)

Adaptive difficulty (AI picks simpler/harder tasks based on child performance).

Multi-player local pass-and-play mini games.

Printable activity sheets that match in-app puzzles.

Teacher cloud dashboard (requires backend + consent).

💬 Acceptance Criteria

Child can complete 5 rounds of mixed tasks without reading.

Visual subtraction clearly shows items removed and remaining.

App runs smoothly on a 2015 Chromebook and an iPad.

Parents can toggle difficulty and see simple progress.
